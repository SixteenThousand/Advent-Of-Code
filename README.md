# Hello!

This repo contains my solutions to Advent of Code problems, an annual set of
coding challenges you can find ![here](https://adventofcode.com/).

Please note I haven't focussed on writing clean code here, just solving the
problems, though if you want to ask me about how I did something, feel free to
raise an issue.
