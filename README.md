Hello!

This repo contains my soltuions to the Advent of Code 2020 problems, which you can find ![here](https://adventofcode.com/2020).
If you're looking at this, you have (hopefully!) been directed here from my CV, and are considering me for a job. I hope this gives you an idea of what I have been doing over the past few months, and what I hope to learn going forward, however, my main work is happening in other repos, such as ![RainSweeper](#) and ![TagExplorer](#).
If you are not an employer, this repo probably has nothing particularly interesting for you, unless you are also trying to do the advent of code 2020 problems and are stuck.
