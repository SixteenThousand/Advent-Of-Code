Hello!

This repo contains my soltuions to the Advent of Code 2020 problems, which you can find ![here](https://adventofcode.com/2020).
If you're looking at this, you are (hopefully!) been directed here from my CV, and are considering me for a job, and I hope this gives you an idea of what I have been doing over the past few months, and what I hope to learn going forward. If not, this repo probably has nothing particularly interesting for you, unless you are also trying to do the advent of code 2020 problems and are stuck.
